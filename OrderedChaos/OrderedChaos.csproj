    <Description>For highly multi-threaded application environments, concurrency becomes an issue for several key areas: data consistency, event handling, or order of operations for various actions.

Without a framework that creates an organization layer between multi-threaded modules, the access of one module to the other is chaotic and prone to thread-locks and performance issues - possibly so much so that the concurrency benefits are offset by the cost of thread-safe context switching.

OrderChaos gives the developer a framework to allow concurrent modules to communicate with others in an ordered, safe, and performant manner.</Description>
